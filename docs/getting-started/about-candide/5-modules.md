# Modules
The same implementation as [Safe](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-modules) Modules](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-modules)

Since CANDIDE is based on Gnosis Safe Contracts, it does have the same implementation as Safe for adding to a wallet.

Thereby it is possible to implement more fine-grained access management. Similar to the Social Recovery Module, it is possible to define other modules. A module can be a feature where wallets have a specific allowance that allows owners of a Candide Wallet to grant limited execution permission, such as a daily limit to external accounts.

More modules are expected to be added in the future.
