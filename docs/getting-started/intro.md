# Introduction

Unleash the power of your wallet through **Account Abstraction**

## About CANDIDE Wallet

Candide Wallet is a smart contract mobile wallet. It enables you to self-custody with ease. 

- Forget seed phrases. Add Recovery Contacts in case you lose access to your wallet
- Pay gas fees in stablecoin or supported ERC-20s
- Dapp in a single tap. Review and approve bundled transactions with a single signature

### How is that possible?

Because each account is a smart contract, contracts are programmable. Unlike EOAs (MetaMask-style wallets), which are limited by design.

CANDIDE is one of the first wallets that offers a path for a decentralized smart contract wallet through [ERC-4337 Account Abstraction](https://medium.com/infinitism/erc-4337-account-abstraction-without-ethereum-protocol-changes-d75c9d94dc4a)
