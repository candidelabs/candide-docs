## What is a Recovery Contact?

An account recovery contact is a person or a device who/which can verify your identity and help you regain access to your account if you ever get locked out. 

Setting up a recovery contact is required, as it makes regaining access to your account possible. You cannot regain access to your account with the same password if you delete the mobile app, or on a different device.

## Who can be your recovery contact?

Anyone with an Ethereum Address can be a recovery contact. CANDIDE recommends adding at least 3 recovery contacts from different backgrounds to secure an account from loss.

### Family and Friends
Your recovery contact should be a person that you know and trust, like a family member or a close friend. You can choose any of your contacts with an Ethereum wallet.

### Email

CANDIDE mobile app offers the possibility of adding a recovery contact with email through Magic Labs. Magic Labs offers a custodial wallet service. They verify their user identity through email authentification. 

### A hardware wallet
You can use your hardware wallet to add yourself as a recovery contact to your account

:::tip Privacy by Design

To protect your privacy, CANDIDE mobile app doesn't know who your recovery contacts are, so you need to remember them
